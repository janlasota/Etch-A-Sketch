# Etch-a-Sketch

Etch A Sketch is a mechanical drawing toy invented by Andr√© Cassagnes of France.
I have recreated it in a web browser.

# Implementation

## Built With

* Vanilla JavaScript
* HTML5
* CSS3

## Generating the Grid

The grid is generated by iterating through two for loops, 'x' being how many
squares are created. The size of the grid is 860x860 px, and that is taken into
consideration when generating the squares.

```
function genDivs(x){
  for(var i = 0; i < x; i++){
    for(var j = 0; j < x; j++){
      var gridItem = document.createElement('div');
      gridItem.className = 'grid-item';
      var gridItemHeight = (860 / x);
      var gridItemWidth = (860 / x);
      gridItem.style.height = gridItemHeight + "px";
      gridItem.style.width = gridItemWidth + "px";
      document.getElementById('grid-container').appendChild(gridItem);
    }
  }
}
```

## Drawing on the Board

Drawing on the board is implemented using a 'mouseover' event. The closest()
method returns the closest grid square and target refers to the element that triggered the 'mouseover' event. Whatever element is closest will have a black
color added to it.

```
var hoverContainer = document.getElementById('grid-container');
hoverContainer.addEventListener('mouseover', function(e) {
  const gridItem = e.target.closest('.grid-item');
  if (gridItem) gridItem.classList.add('hoverColor');
});
```

## Clearing the Board

parentNode is used to refer to the grid container and the removeChild() method
removes the first grid item in the container. The container continues to shrink
until the while loop is false, i.e. when there are no more grid items remaining
in the container.

```
function clearGrid(){
  var elements = document.getElementsByClassName('grid-item');
  while(elements.length > 0){
    elements[0].parentNode.removeChild(elements[0]);
  }
  gridSize();
}
```

# Future Plans

* Add more detail to the page
* Fix erase toggling on after the "do not" symbol
* Add different hover colors
